  As an automation engineer
  I want to replay the AI agent's recorded actions
  So that I can reproduce the same workflow consistently

  @ai-recorded @replay
  Scenario: Replay AI Agent Task - Use the windows key to search for notepad and open it and then type hello world
    # Original AI task: Use the windows key to search for notepad and open it and then type hello world
    # Execution completed: Successfully
    
    # === Iteration 1 ===
    When I take a screenshot "iteration-1-start.png"
    And I press key "Win"
    And I type text "notepad"
    And I press key "Enter"
    And I type text "hello world"
    And I wait for 2 seconds  # Post-action delay
    And I take a screenshot "iteration-1-end.png"

    # === Verification ===
    Then the workflow should be completed
    And the task "Use the windows key to search for notepad and open it and then type hello world" should be successful
