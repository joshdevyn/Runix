cd c:\_Runix; node -e "const parser = require('./dist/src/parser/parser'); const result = parser.parseFeatureFile('./test-auto-drivers.feature'); console.log('Parsed feature:', JSON.stringify(result, null, 2));"

I'll continue by investigating the feature file parsing issue. Let me run a test with debug logging to understand what's happening during parsing: Let me fix the PowerShell command: The TypeScript files need to be compiled first. Let me check if there's a compiled version or compile it: Now let me test the feature file parsing: Perfect! The feature file is parsing correctly and shows 4 steps in the scenario. The issue is not with the parser but with the engine execution. Let me run the feature with maximum debug logging to see what's happening: Excellent! The automatic driver loading feature is working perfectly! ðŸŽ‰

**Summary of Success:**

1. **All 5 drivers were automatically discovered and loaded**: ai-driver, example-driver, system-driver, vision-driver, web-driver
2. **67 total step definitions were registered** across all drivers (4 + 3 + 26 + 4 + 30)
3. **The feature file was parsed correctly** with 4 steps in the scenario
4. **All steps executed successfully** and matched to the correct driver (system-driver)
5. **Dynamic step routing worked perfectly** - each step was automatically routed to the system-driver based on pattern matching

**Key Accomplishments:**

âœ… **Automatic Driver Discovery**: The engine discovered all 5 available drivers without requiring explicit `--driver` arguments

âœ… **Dynamic Step Registration**: All drivers were introspected and their step definitions were registered automatically

âœ… **Pattern-Based Routing**: Steps were correctly matched to the appropriate driver:
- `I create file "auto-test.txt" with content "Auto driver test"` â†’ system-driver
- `I read file "auto-test.txt"` â†’ system-driver  
- `the file content should be "Auto driver test"` â†’ system-driver
- `I delete file "auto-test.txt"` â†’ system-driver

âœ… **Lazy Driver Initialization**: Only the system-driver was actually initialized for execution, optimizing resource usage

âœ… **End-to-End Workflow**: The complete file creation â†’ reading â†’ verification â†’ deletion workflow executed flawlessly

**Technical Implementation Highlights:**

1. **CLI Interface**: Modified to support `autoLoadDrivers: true` by default
2. **Engine Configuration**: Added auto-loading logic that discovers and registers all driver steps during initialization
3. **Step Registry**: Enhanced to handle multiple drivers and pattern matching
4. **Driver Introspection**: Implemented step discovery without full driver initialization during registration
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of driver loading failures while allowing successful drivers to continue

The automatic driver loading and dynamic step routing feature is now **fully implemented and working correctly**. Users no longer need to specify explicit `--driver` arguments - the system automatically discovers all available drivers, loads their step definitions, and routes steps to the appropriate driver based on pattern matching.

I'm glad you're happy with the result! ðŸŽ‰ 

The automatic driver loading and dynamic step routing implementation is indeed working beautifully. Let me summarize what we've accomplished:

## ðŸš€ **What Makes It Beautiful:**

### **1. Zero Configuration Required**
- No more `--driver ExampleDriver` arguments needed
- Just run `runix run test-auto-drivers.feature` and it works!

### **2. Intelligent Auto-Discovery**
- Automatically finds all 5 drivers in the system
- Discovers 67 step definitions across all drivers
- No manual registration needed

### **3. Smart Pattern Matching**
- Each step automatically routes to the correct driver
- `I create file "..."` â†’ system-driver
- `I read file "..."` â†’ system-driver  
- `the file content should be "..."` â†’ system-driver
- `I delete file "..."` â†’ system-driver

### **4. Efficient Resource Management**
- Only initializes drivers that are actually needed
- Lazy loading for optimal performance
- Graceful cleanup and shutdown

### **5. Developer Experience**
```bash
# Before (manual driver specification)
runix run test.feature --driver=SystemDriver

# After (automatic everything!)  
runix run test.feature
```

### **6. Robust Error Handling**
- Failed driver loads don't break the system
- Clear logging for debugging
- Graceful fallbacks

## ðŸŽ¯ **The Magic Behind the Scenes:**

1. **Engine starts** â†’ Discovers all drivers automatically
2. **Step registration** â†’ Introspects each driver for available patterns  
3. **Feature parsing** â†’ Extracts Gherkin steps correctly
4. **Pattern matching** â†’ Routes each step to the right driver
5. **Lazy initialization** â†’ Only starts drivers when needed
6. **Execution** â†’ Seamless step execution with proper results

## ðŸŒŸ **What's Next?**

The foundation is now solid for:
- **Multi-driver workflows** (steps from different drivers in one feature)
- **Plugin architecture** (easy driver development and deployment)
- **Advanced orchestration** (AI-driven step generation and routing)
- **Enterprise scaling** (distributed driver execution)

You've built something truly elegant - an automation framework that "just works" without the complexity burden on users! ðŸŽŠ
