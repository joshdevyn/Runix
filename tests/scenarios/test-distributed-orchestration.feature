Feature: Distributed AI Orchestration and Enterprise Scaling
  Demonstrate advanced multi-driver coordination, distributed execution,
  error recovery, and enterprise scaling capabilities

  Background:
    Given the AI Orchestrator is initialized with enhanced capabilities
    And a distributed cluster is configured with 3 worker nodes
    And learning patterns are loaded from previous sessions

  Scenario: Intelligent Multi-Driver Workflow with Learning
    Given I analyze intent "Create a comprehensive report from web data and images"
    When I build workflow context including current screen state
    And I generate intelligent plan using AI and historical patterns
    Then the plan should include optimal driver selection
    And the confidence score should be above 0.8
    And alternative approaches should be provided
    
    When I execute the intelligent workflow
    Then system driver should handle file operations
    And web driver should manage browser interactions  
    And vision driver should process screenshots
    And AI driver should coordinate and analyze results
    And learning patterns should be updated from execution

  Scenario: Distributed Workflow Execution
    Given multiple complex workflows are submitted simultaneously
    When I submit 5 parallel workflows to the distributed cluster
    Then jobs should be distributed across available worker nodes
    And load balancing should optimize worker utilization
    And job queue should prioritize high-priority tasks
    And execution metrics should track performance
    
    When workers complete their assigned jobs
    Then results should be properly coordinated
    And workflow history should be updated
    And performance metrics should reflect actual execution times

  Scenario: Advanced Error Recovery with Alternative Approaches
    Given a multi-step workflow is executing
    When a driver encounters an unexpected error
    Then the AI should analyze the error context
    And generate alternative execution approaches
    And automatically retry with different driver combinations
    And learn from the error for future prevention
    
    When manual intervention is required
    Then a comprehensive error report should be generated
    And recovery suggestions should be provided
    And the workflow should be safely paused

  Scenario: Enterprise Auto-Scaling
    Given the cluster is monitoring queue size and worker utilization
    When job queue exceeds threshold and workers are heavily loaded
    Then additional worker nodes should be automatically provisioned
    And new jobs should be distributed to new workers
    And performance should improve with increased capacity
    
    When demand decreases and workers become idle
    Then excess workers should be gracefully scaled down
    And cost optimization should be maintained
    And minimum worker count should be preserved

  Scenario: Performance Monitoring and Optimization
    Given workflows have been executing for extended periods
    When performance analysis is triggered
    Then driver performance profiles should be updated
    And workflow optimization suggestions should be generated
    And bottlenecks should be identified and reported
    
    When optimization recommendations are applied
    Then subsequent workflows should show improved performance
    And success rates should increase
    And execution times should decrease

  Scenario: Capability-Based Driver Selection
    Given various task types with different requirements
    When I request image analysis and file processing
    Then vision driver should be selected for image tasks
    And system driver should handle file operations
    And driver capabilities should be matched to task requirements
    And performance history should influence selection
    
    When drivers are unavailable or performing poorly
    Then alternative drivers should be automatically selected
    And execution should continue with adapted approaches
    And fallback strategies should be employed

  Scenario: Parallel Execution with Dependency Management
    Given a complex workflow with interdependent steps
    When I execute tasks that can run in parallel
    Then independent operations should run simultaneously
    And dependent steps should wait for prerequisites
    And resource conflicts should be avoided
    And execution time should be optimized
    
    When dependencies are resolved
    Then subsequent steps should execute immediately
    And overall workflow completion should be accelerated
    And coordination between parallel streams should be maintained

  Scenario: Real-time Cluster Monitoring
    Given the distributed cluster is processing multiple workflows
    When I query cluster status in real-time
    Then worker node statuses should be current
    And job queue metrics should be accurate
    And performance metrics should reflect current state
    And resource utilization should be tracked
    
    When issues are detected
    Then alerts should be generated
    And automatic remediation should be attempted
    And manual intervention guidance should be provided

  Scenario: Graceful Cluster Shutdown
    Given active workflows are executing across the cluster
    When cluster shutdown is initiated
    Then new job submissions should be rejected
    And active jobs should be allowed to complete
    And workers should finish current tasks gracefully
    And data consistency should be maintained
    
    When shutdown timeout is reached
    Then remaining jobs should be safely terminated
    And state should be preserved for restart
    And cleanup should be performed completely
