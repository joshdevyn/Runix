Feature: Advanced Multi-Driver Orchestration
  Demonstrate intelligent cross-driver coordination with automatic dependency resolution
  and dynamic workflow adaptation based on runtime conditions

  Scenario: AI-Orchestrated Cross-Driver Workflow
    # AI Driver analyzes intent and creates execution plan
    Given I analyze intent "Set up a complete testing environment with file validation"
    When I orchestrate workflow
    And I generate feature for intent "Comprehensive testing workflow"
    
    # System Driver: Environment preparation with dynamic configuration
    Then I create file "config.json" with content '{"env":"test","drivers":["system","web","vision","ai"]}'
    And I execute command "echo 'Environment setup complete'"
    
    # Web Driver: Dynamic page interaction based on AI analysis
    When I open the browser at "https://httpbin.org/html"
    And I take a screenshot "01-initial-page.png"
    
    # Vision Driver: Intelligent element detection and analysis
    Then I extract text from screenshot
    And I detect UI elements in screenshot
    And I analyze scene in screenshot
    
    # AI Driver: Smart decision making based on vision analysis
    And I analyze intent "Based on the detected UI elements, interact with the most prominent form"
    And I enhance with AI "Use vision data to determine optimal interaction strategy"
    
    # System Driver: Results validation and reporting
    And I create file "test-results.json" with content '{"status":"success","drivers_used":4,"coordination":"optimal"}'
    And the file content should contain "success"
    
    # AI Driver: Generate comprehensive report
    And I generate answer for "Summarize the multi-driver workflow execution and results"

  Scenario: Dynamic Driver Selection Based on Capabilities
    # AI automatically selects best drivers for each task
    Given I analyze intent "Process an image file and extract data"
    When I discover available drivers
    Then I should select VisionDriver for image processing
    And I should select SystemDriver for file operations
    And I should coordinate execution between selected drivers

  Scenario: Error Recovery Across Drivers
    # Test resilience with driver failures
    Given I start a multi-driver workflow
    When one driver encounters an error
    Then the AI should detect the failure
    And automatically retry with alternative approach
    And continue workflow with remaining drivers
    And generate failure analysis report

  Scenario: Parallel Driver Execution
    # Multiple drivers working simultaneously
    Given I have tasks that can run in parallel
    When I execute system file operations
    And I simultaneously run web browser tests
    And I process screenshots with vision driver
    Then all operations should complete efficiently
    And results should be properly coordinated
    And no resource conflicts should occur
