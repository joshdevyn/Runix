Feature: AI Driver Test Scenarios
  These scenarios are designed to test AI driver functionality
  in controlled conditions with predictable outcomes

  Background:
    Given the AI driver is available
    And test mode is enabled

  @ai @fixture @agent
  Scenario: Agent mode basic task execution
    When the AI agent is given task "Echo hello world"
    Then the agent should plan appropriate steps
    And execute the steps successfully
    And generate a feature file artifact

  @ai @fixture @editor
  Scenario: Editor mode observation simulation
    When the AI editor starts session "test-observation"
    Then the editor should begin observing actions
    And provide session management capabilities

  @ai @fixture @ask
  Scenario: Ask mode question processing
    When the AI is asked "What can you do?"
    Then the AI should provide helpful information
    And not perform any actions

  @ai @fixture @ask @action
  Scenario: Ask mode with action request
    When the AI is asked "Click the test button"
    Then the AI should analyze the request
    And attempt to perform the requested action
    And generate a feature file for the action

  @ai @fixture @planning
  Scenario: Task planning capabilities
    Given a task description "Login and check dashboard"
    When the AI plans the task
    Then the plan should include logical steps
    And use appropriate drivers
    And provide confidence scores

  @ai @fixture @coordination
  Scenario: Multi-driver coordination
    Given multiple drivers are available
    When the AI executes a cross-driver workflow
    Then it should coordinate between drivers effectively
    And handle driver dependencies correctly

  @ai @fixture @error-handling
  Scenario: Error recovery testing
    Given a task that will encounter errors
    When the AI attempts to execute the task
    Then it should handle errors gracefully
    And attempt recovery strategies
    And request help when appropriate

  @ai @fixture @feature-generation
  Scenario: Feature file generation validation
    When the AI completes any task
    Then it should generate a valid Gherkin feature file
    And the feature should be syntactically correct
    And contain appropriate scenario structure
    And be executable by the Runix engine
